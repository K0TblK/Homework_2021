Minecraft Championships
In 2020, Technoblade participated in Noxcrew's and Dangthatsalongname's MC Championship event, an event where YouTubers and streamers would come together to play a wide variety of fancy minigames. The tournament consists of 10 teams and 40 players, featuring a variety of custom minigames. The prize is a special MCC coin by Noxcrew.

Techno is the only player in said tournament to have played in more than one event and never leave the Top 10 Individual Leaderboard.

Techno and Quig are the only 2 players in the tournament to score Top 2 Individual with a team 5th place and lower.

Techno currently holds the Individual point record in the tournament, with an Individual score of 4307 points. Techno also currently holds the record for the highest point differential over 2nd place, his lead was almost 1000 points.

Techno also has the second-highest debut MCC performance ever with a whopping 3665 points, only behind TommyInnit with 3686.

In MCC P21, teammate Wilbur Soot experienced an unexpected fire alarm during Game 5, Parkour Tag. After the round, Noxcrew temporarily substituted Ph1LzA while Wilbur was away dealing with the fire alarm. Wilbur returned to MCC after Game 6, Battle Box. The team also came 3rd by 2 points to the Orange Ocelots, with scores of 22765 and 22767, respectively.

On 26 July 2021, Smajor confirmed on his stream that Technoblade has no plans to play in future tournaments except for possibly All Stars and/or charity events.
